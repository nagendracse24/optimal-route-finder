Features
Find the shortest path between two stations using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Visual representation of the metro map.
User-friendly command-line interface.
Detailed route information, including total distance and travel time.
Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Optimal-Route-Finder.git
cd Optimal-Route-Finder
Install Required Packages
Use the following command to install the necessary Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the prompts to enter the starting and ending stations.

The application will output the optimal route, along with details such as distance and estimated travel time.

Architecture
The Optimal Route Finder application is structured into several modules, each responsible for specific functionalities:

Main Module: Handles user input and initiates the route-finding process.
Graph Module: Represents the metro system as a graph, with stations as nodes and routes as edges.
Algorithm Module: Implements Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path.
Data Visualization Module: (Optional) Visualizes the metro map and the calculated route.

Data Structures
The application uses a graph data structure to represent the metro system. Each station is a node, and each route is an edge connecting the nodes. The graph is implemented using an adjacency list for efficient space and time complexity.

Example of Graph Representation
python
Copy code
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stations = {}  # Dictionary to store station names and their connections

    def add_edge(self, station1, station2, weight):
        # Adds a bi-directional edge between two stations with a specified weight
        if station1 not in self.stations:
            self.stations[station1] = {}
        if station2 not in self.stations:
            self.stations[station2] = {}
        self.stations[station1][station2] = weight
        self.stations[station2][station1] = weight
Algorithms
The primary algorithm used for finding the optimal route is Dijkstra's algorithm, which efficiently finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.

Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation
python
Copy code
def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
    # Returns the shortest paths from the start station to all other stations
    pass  # Your implementation here
