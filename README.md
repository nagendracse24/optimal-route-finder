Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/nagendracse24/Optimal-Route-Finder.git
cd Optimal-Route-Finder
Install Required Packages
Use the following command to install the necessary Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the prompts to enter the starting and ending stations.

The application will output the optimal route, along with details such as distance and estimated travel time.

Architecture
The Optimal Route Finder application is structured into several modules, each responsible for specific functionalities:

Main Module: Handles user input and initiates the route-finding process.
Graph Module: Represents the metro system as a graph, with stations as nodes and routes as edges.
Algorithm Module: Implements Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path.
Data Visualization Module: (Optional) Visualizes the metro map and the calculated route.

Data Structures
The application uses a graph data structure to represent the metro system. Each station is a node, and each route is an edge connecting the nodes. The graph is implemented using an adjacency list for efficient space and time complexity.

Example of Graph Representation
python
Copy code
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stations = {}  # Dictionary to store station names and their connections

    def add_edge(self, station1, station2, weight):
        # Adds a bi-directional edge between two stations with a specified weight
        if station1 not in self.stations:
            self.stations[station1] = {}
        if station2 not in self.stations:
            self.stations[station2] = {}
        self.stations[station1][station2] = weight
        self.stations[station2][station1] = weight
Algorithms
The primary algorithm used for finding the optimal route is Dijkstra's algorithm, which efficiently finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.

Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation
python
Copy code
def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
    # Returns the shortest paths from the start station to all other stations
    pass  # Your implementation here

Architecture
The Optimal Route Finder application is designed using a modular architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of use. Below is an overview of the architecture components:

1. Overview
The application implements a graph-based approach to find the optimal route on a metro map. It uses algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between two stations.

2. Components
User Interface (UI)

Description: The UI is built using [mention the framework or library you used, e.g., Tkinter, Flask, etc.]. It allows users to input starting and destination stations and displays the calculated route along with additional information.
Responsibilities:
Accept user inputs for source and destination stations.
Display the optimal route and other relevant details, such as total distance and travel time.
Route Calculation Module

Description: This module contains the core logic for route calculation, utilizing graph algorithms.
Responsibilities:
Represent the metro map as a graph using adjacency lists or matrices.
Implement the Dijkstra algorithm (or other pathfinding algorithms) to determine the shortest path.
Handle edge cases, such as unreachable stations.
Data Storage

Description: The application stores metro station data and routes in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV, or a database).
Responsibilities:
Load metro map data into the application.
Provide methods to update and manage station and route data.
Configuration Management

Description: A configuration module manages application settings and constants, such as metro station names and distances.
Responsibilities:
Store and manage configuration data for easy access and modification.
Facilitate easy adjustments to routes and stations without altering core logic.
3. Data Flow
User Interaction: The user inputs the starting and destination stations via the UI.
Data Retrieval: The application retrieves the metro map data from the data storage.
Route Calculation: The route calculation module processes the input using graph algorithms to find the optimal path.
Output Display: The calculated route and additional details are displayed on the UI for the user.
4. Dependencies
List any external libraries or frameworks used in the project (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, etc.).
5. Future Enhancements
Potential enhancements include:
Integration of real-time data for train schedules.
Adding more metro lines and stations to the map.
Implementing user accounts for personalized settings.
This architecture section should provide users and contributors with a clear understanding of how the application is structured and how its components int
