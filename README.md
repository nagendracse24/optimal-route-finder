Data Structures
The application uses a graph data structure to represent the metro system. Each station is a node, and each route is an edge connecting the nodes. The graph is implemented using an adjacency list for efficient space and time complexity.

Example of Graph Representation
python
Copy code
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stations = {}  # Dictionary to store station names and their connections

    def add_edge(self, station1, station2, weight):
        # Adds a bi-directional edge between two stations with a specified weight
        if station1 not in self.stations:
            self.stations[station1] = {}
        if station2 not in self.stations:
            self.stations[station2] = {}
        self.stations[station1][station2] = weight
        self.stations[station2][station1] = weight
Algorithms
The primary algorithm used for finding the optimal route is Dijkstra's algorithm, which efficiently finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.

Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation
python
Copy code
def dijkstra(graph, start):
    # Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
    # Returns the shortest paths from the start station to all other stations
    pass  # Your implementation here

ARCHITECTURE OF OPTIMAL ROUTE FINDER**

The architecture and design of a software system like the Delhi Metro navigation application can be described in terms of its components, relationships, and static structure. Below is a detailed breakdown of the overall system architecture, class design, and the relationships among the components.

### Architecture Overview

1. **Layered Architecture**: 
   - **Presentation Layer**: Manages user interaction and displays information.
   - **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the algorithms for graph management, including adding/removing vertices and edges, calculating shortest paths, and handling user commands.
   - **Data Layer**: Represents the underlying data structure (graph) used to store stations and connections.

### Class Design

Here's a static UML-like representation of the classes involved in the system:

### Components Breakdown

1. **Graph_M**:
   - The main class responsible for representing the graph where vertices are metro stations and edges represent the connecting routes with weights (distance or time).
   - Contains methods to manage vertices and edges and to perform pathfinding algorithms.

2. **Vertex**:
   - Represents a station in the metro system.
   - Stores neighboring stations and the distances to those neighbors as a hashmap.

3. **DijkstraPair**:
   - Used in the Dijkstra algorithm to store information for each node (station) during the pathfinding process.
   - Implements the `Comparable` interface to facilitate priority queue operations.

4. **Pair**:
   - Used for storing minimum distance and time information for each station during pathfinding searches.

### Static State Design

- **Attributes**:
   - **vtces** (in `Graph_M`): Storage for all vertices (stations) in the form of a HashMap where the key is the station name and the value is a `Vertex` object.
   - **nbrs** (in `Vertex`): A hashmap that holds neighbors (connected stations) and the distances (weights) to them.

- **Relationships**:
   - **Composition**:
      - `Graph_M` contains multiple `Vertex` objects, each representing a metro station.
      - Each `Vertex` contains references to its neighboring stations (stored in the `nbrs` hashmap).

### Use Case Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `Graph_M` class is instantiated.
   - `Create_Metro_Map(g)` method populates the graph with metro stations (vertices) and connections (edges).

2. **User Interaction**:
   - The user is prompted to choose an action from a list (display stations, find shortest path, etc.).
   - The corresponding method in `Graph_M` is invoked based on the user’s choice.

3. **Pathfinding**:
   - For pathfinding, methods like `dijkstra` or `Get_Minimum_Distance` are called, invoking the core logic to calculate paths between two stations based on user input.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing, the results (like shortest distance or available interchanges) are displayed to the user.

### Summary

This structured view of the Delhi Metro navigation system enables better understanding and maintainability. Each class has a clear purpose, with responsibilities segregated to foster clean interaction patterns within the system. The design can be adapted or extended to accommodate more advanced features or integrate with a front-end interface for enhanced user experience.
